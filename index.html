<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
<b>Hello :)</b> 

This should be a great blog having many posts about how i'm doing on my journey, and a bit of tips for you maybe, but i'm busy building mobile apps now more than web, or even content, so i'll keep it simple.
<br>
Currently learning swift, and by that i mean all about iOS and xCode, reading books, watching tutorials, and so on.</p>
<br>
<p>I also workout, run, read and write in my freetime, i'll update this to full blog maybe later, it's already on the plan</p>

CV? well, it's in the making currently ..
